        <h3>Amazon</h3>
        <p>
          Some of my responsibilities were to label & accurately moved customers orders to meet shipment timetables while minimizing errors. Also maintained strong vendor connections, including arranging pricing and delivery structures & managing specific shipment or paperwork concerns. This is helped me learn the logistical side of the company and made me think of ways I could help on the software side of this kind of work. 
        </p>
        <h3>Lowes</h3>
        <p>
          Roles included coordinating efficient restocking of sales floorwith current merchandise and accurate signage for current promotions. Also offered each customer top-notch, personal service, & polite support to boost sales and customer satisfaction. This job was crucial for me as it was my very first job which led me to grow into a working environment where communication, team-work, and customer service was key in order to suceed.
